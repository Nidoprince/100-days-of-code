### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing part of my mahjong over discord project.  Specifically calling Kan during your own turn in order to add to a Kong or create a closed Kong.

**Thoughts** I mostly just wanted to get something going today, so I just continued work on something I already had started.  Hoping to start coding new stuff and pushing myself to learn more stuff in later days.

### Day 2: June 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting tsumo to work in the mahjong game.  Ended up mostly testing things, but got some good work done.

**Thoughts** Lots of testing today, which needed doing, but resulted in less lines of actual coding.  Started doing some research on what I am thinking about for my next topic.

### Day 3: June 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished tsumo stuff.  Did the code for going to the next round after a round is finished.  Got dora calculator written.

**Thoughts** Pretty much pure code today.  Lots of different diverse elements figured out.  Did a lot of research during the day about my future project.  Trying to get my head wrapped around the math.

### Day 4: June 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Riichi, and a lot of stuff which was needed for that.  

**Thoughts** Did my coding right after waking up today, instead of right before I went to bed.  Didn't code for as long, but the time felt like it was going by faster.

### Day 5: June 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got all the of the flags for the Yaku which cared about game state implemented.

**Thoughts** Chill day.  Not much to report.  Just kinda plugging along.

### Day 6: June 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Bunch of small things implemented.  Liability, max of 4 kongs, kuikae, refactored old pon and chi code

**Thoughts** Basically a day of finding little things to implement.  Kinda hard near the end, as I'm running out of stuff to implment.  Just a few more big things and then the game will be playable.

### Day 7: June 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got a tenpai checking function written, which allowed me to write the code for when the game ends in a draw.  

**Thoughts** A week in as of today.  Its pretty cool how much I am getting done, even if I am only doing an hour or two each day.  This project kinda felt like it would last forever, but now it feels like it is almost done.

### Day 9: June 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got ron coded.  Lots of little bits of this one.

**Thoughts** Worked for a good long while.  One little edge case still needing to be dealt with, but otherwise, the main functionality of the game is done, but still pending testing.

### Day 10: June 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added a bunch of small things I had missed.  Big thing today was changing scoring so that it could account for ties.

**Thoughts** For the scoring bit, I first started with a really naive solution, but got so bored writing the code for it that I went back, deleted everything, and wrote a much more elegant solution.

### Day 11: June 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote testing function, and began testing hands.  Tons of bug fixes in the scoring algorithm.

**Thoughts** Fun to get into all the testing stuff.  A bunch of bugs squashed.  Good times.

### Day 13: June 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing.  Fixed more bugs.

**Thoughts** Went and tested every yaku in the game.  Need to test the game state based one's slightly differently, but all the purely hand based ones at least function.

### Day 14: June 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing.  Fixed more bugs.

**Thoughts** Testing this time was a lot less clean, because it was game state stuff, instead of pure hand scoring stuff.  Just kinding grinding through games, looking for bugs to pop up.

### Day 15: June 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Did a bit more testing, fixed some bugs.  Added a toggleable system that helps inform players when they have the option of doing things in game.

**Thoughts** Hanging out with friends for the day, so less focused than usual, but still got a useful new feature pushed.

### Day 16: July 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Testing ron, and tsumo.  Set up a system for testing so I can choose the tiles that get drawn.

**Thoughts** Kinda a weird day.  I was kinda distracted while coding, so it wasn't insanely efficient, but I got it done.

### Day 17: July 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take a day off of mahjong, and started going through a tutorial to make a multiplayer web game.  Built the basic skeleton of a game today.

**Thoughts** Got started really late today, and just kinda felt braindead, so doing a tutorial and mostly copying code was what I felt up to today.  Still kinda fun regardless.

### Day 18: July 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tested.  No bugs found today.  One bug that I am pretty sure I didn't fix, fixed itself.

**Thoughts** Lots of stuff got in the way today.  Didn't get the full hour done, but still tested a game.

### Day 19: July 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Tested.  Fixed bugs in kan, and in the help system.

**Thoughts**  Kinda undirected testing today.  Just playing games, and trying out as many different possible things I could, trying to break the system.

### Day 20: July 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Lots of bug fixes.  Fixed array testing, kan timing, timing in general, and ippatsu detection.

**Thoughts**  Getting into the more insidious bugs now.  Or possibly I am just more tired than I have been when doing these.  Either way, more trouble finding the bugs than in the past.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 21: July 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on testing liability, furiten, stealing the kong, and pon vs chi priority.  Fixed bugs related to those areas.

**Thoughts**  Nice seeing this working more and more.  Having things stand up to testing is always nice.  Still, found a lot of bugs today, though they weren't as bad as yesterday.

### Day 22: July 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished testing liability.  Made liability and stealing the kong more explicit within the game.  Added a help command in order for people to learn about akagibot.

**Thoughts**  Nothing too strenuous today.  Mostly just making the game more helpful and informative while you are playing, and adding in the help system so that people can check up on commands they don't know or remember how to use.

### Day 24: July 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added new commands to translate and score yaku, made some functions better named, made the game output appropriately to the game observation channel.

**Thoughts**  It was nice getting to code during the early part of the day again, instead of when I am dead tired.  Got a fair amount of stuff done today.

### Day 25: July 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created three planets, and added gravity to them in the multiplayer game.

**Thoughts**  Inspired by the book 'The Three Body Problem', I decided to work on my multiplayer game today, wanting to do something with gravity and the orbits of suns and planets.  Added the basic structure for a three body system.

### Day 28: July 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got the game up online, and added a zoom functionality, as well as a brief description of controls at bottom of page.

**Thoughts**  Figuring how to get it working online involved a lot of beating my head against a wall, but it was really cool once it worked.  Zoom involved a lot of math intuition.  People have actually derived some amount of pleasure from this game now.

### Day 38: July 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spread code out among different files, smoothed out animations, and added fuel spawns on planets.

**Thoughts**  Its interesting seeing where this game goes as I continue to code it.  Originally just thought of it as a space battle sim, but I definitely want to include some non violent stuff now.

### Day 40: July 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added fuel mining, fueling up one's ship, and flying a spaceship now uses fuel.

**Thoughts**  Generally a solid day.  Some animation stuff for the fuel bar, and a some angle problems for the fuel at first caused some problems, but generally things worked out today.

### Day 53: August 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made asteroids appear and disappear instead of having a static number of them.

**Thoughts**  Started seeing some lag when zoomed out.  Unsure if its because of something I changed today or if its because of other stuff I was doing on my computer while also testing.
