# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing part of my mahjong over discord project.  Specifically calling Kan during your own turn in order to add to a Kong or create a closed Kong.

**Thoughts** I mostly just wanted to get something going today, so I just continued work on something I already had started.  Hoping to start coding new stuff and pushing myself to learn more stuff in later days.
