### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing part of my mahjong over discord project.  Specifically calling Kan during your own turn in order to add to a Kong or create a closed Kong.

**Thoughts** I mostly just wanted to get something going today, so I just continued work on something I already had started.  Hoping to start coding new stuff and pushing myself to learn more stuff in later days.

### Day 2: June 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting tsumo to work in the mahjong game.  Ended up mostly testing things, but got some good work done.

**Thoughts** Lots of testing today, which needed doing, but resulted in less lines of actual coding.  Started doing some research on what I am thinking about for my next topic.

### Day 3: June 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished tsumo stuff.  Did the code for going to the next round after a round is finished.  Got dora calculator written.

**Thoughts** Pretty much pure code today.  Lots of different diverse elements figured out.  Did a lot of research during the day about my future project.  Trying to get my head wrapped around the math.
