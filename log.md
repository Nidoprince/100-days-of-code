### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing part of my mahjong over discord project.  Specifically calling Kan during your own turn in order to add to a Kong or create a closed Kong.

**Thoughts** I mostly just wanted to get something going today, so I just continued work on something I already had started.  Hoping to start coding new stuff and pushing myself to learn more stuff in later days.

### Day 2: June 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting tsumo to work in the mahjong game.  Ended up mostly testing things, but got some good work done.

**Thoughts** Lots of testing today, which needed doing, but resulted in less lines of actual coding.  Started doing some research on what I am thinking about for my next topic.

### Day 3: June 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished tsumo stuff.  Did the code for going to the next round after a round is finished.  Got dora calculator written.

**Thoughts** Pretty much pure code today.  Lots of different diverse elements figured out.  Did a lot of research during the day about my future project.  Trying to get my head wrapped around the math.

### Day 4: June 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Riichi, and a lot of stuff which was needed for that.  

**Thoughts** Did my coding right after waking up today, instead of right before I went to bed.  Didn't code for as long, but the time felt like it was going by faster.

### Day 5: June 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got all the of the flags for the Yaku which cared about game state implemented.

**Thoughts** Chill day.  Not much to report.  Just kinda plugging along.

### Day 6: June 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Bunch of small things implemented.  Liability, max of 4 kongs, kuikae, refactored old pon and chi code

**Thoughts** Basically a day of finding little things to implement.  Kinda hard near the end, as I'm running out of stuff to implment.  Just a few more big things and then the game will be playable.

### Day 7: June 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got a tenpai checking function written, which allowed me to write the code for when the game ends in a draw.  

**Thoughts** A week in as of today.  Its pretty cool how much I am getting done, even if I am only doing an hour or two each day.  This project kinda felt like it would last forever, but now it feels like it is almost done.

### Day 8: June 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Got furiten and game end stuff coded.

### Day 9: June 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got ron coded.  Lots of little bits of this one.

**Thoughts** Worked for a good long while.  One little edge case still needing to be dealt with, but otherwise, the main functionality of the game is done, but still pending testing.

### Day 10: June 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added a bunch of small things I had missed.  Big thing today was changing scoring so that it could account for ties.

**Thoughts** For the scoring bit, I first started with a really naive solution, but got so bored writing the code for it that I went back, deleted everything, and wrote a much more elegant solution.

### Day 11: June 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote testing function, and began testing hands.  Tons of bug fixes in the scoring algorithm.

**Thoughts** Fun to get into all the testing stuff.  A bunch of bugs squashed.  Good times.

### Day 12: June 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing.  Fixed more bugs.

**Thoughts** Got all the example hands from the EMA rules tested, as well as all the yakuman hands.

### Day 13: June 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing.  Fixed more bugs.

**Thoughts** Went and tested every yaku in the game.  Need to test the game state based one's slightly differently, but all the purely hand based ones at least function.

### Day 14: June 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing.  Fixed more bugs.

**Thoughts** Testing this time was a lot less clean, because it was game state stuff, instead of pure hand scoring stuff.  Just kinding grinding through games, looking for bugs to pop up.

### Day 15: June 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Did a bit more testing, fixed some bugs.  Added a toggleable system that helps inform players when they have the option of doing things in game.

**Thoughts** Hanging out with friends for the day, so less focused than usual, but still got a useful new feature pushed.

### Day 16: July 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Testing ron, and tsumo.  Set up a system for testing so I can choose the tiles that get drawn.

**Thoughts** Kinda a weird day.  I was kinda distracted while coding, so it wasn't insanely efficient, but I got it done.

### Day 17: July 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take a day off of mahjong, and started going through a tutorial to make a multiplayer web game.  Built the basic skeleton of a game today.

**Thoughts** Got started really late today, and just kinda felt braindead, so doing a tutorial and mostly copying code was what I felt up to today.  Still kinda fun regardless.

### Day 18: July 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tested.  No bugs found today.  One bug that I am pretty sure I didn't fix, fixed itself.

**Thoughts** Lots of stuff got in the way today.  Didn't get the full hour done, but still tested a game.
